        <p> Hi my name is Zack Hatch, and I am a ginger so to represent me I choose a piece of ginger because well, I am a ginger (A ginger is a caucasian person with red hair and freckles).  I am 16 years old and I play waterpolo and I am on the mountain biking team for San Rafael High School.</p>
