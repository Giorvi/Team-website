    <p> Hello, my name is Brandon Navone and this is my personal webpage. I was born in Greenbrae, CA on December 9th, 1999. I am a Scout and I love the outdoors and outdoor activities such as backpacking and hiking. My goals are to graduate from uiversity and live with my girlfriend. During my Junior year in highschool, I spent a year abroad in Italy with a host family and I had a wonderful time. I met many people from all over the world, including my girlfriend, and I speak Italian.</p>
